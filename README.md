To complete this course: Host the registration form that we demonstrated in this level using GitHub Pages.

You'll need to make one additional change to the registration form (details below), host it online, and then share its link with us.

What you need to do
Your registration form must have all the functionality demonstrated in this level, including loading of saved data from web storage.

Add additional validations to the date input field so that it accepts date of birth for people between ages 18 and 55 only. You'll need to figure out how to do this.

Host your website on GitHub pages, and share the link to a hosted version of your website.

Please ensure that...
...your website is live, and accessible.
...the link you share shows the registration form along with the table element. The table should be empty when we first visit the webpage.
The table element's header should contain the following columns with the exact text: Name, Email, Password, Dob, and Accepted terms?.
...the input elements must have the id values demonstrated in this level. i.e., name, email, password, and dob.
...there must be an <input> element with type="checkbox".
...there must be a <button> with type="submit".
Your submission will be reviewed automatically using a test script. The conditions mentioned above should be followed exactly to ensure that these tests can identify and interact with your webpage.
